This folder contains the script for visualization.

#### Visualization
Use this command to generate the interactive visualization:

`plot_heteroplasmy.py "genome_name" annotation.csv heteroplasmy.csv conserved_scores.csv het_visualization.html`

where:
- genome_name is a name of genome (string)
- annotation.csv is annotation file
- heteroplasmy.csv is a file containing all heteroplasmy sites. This file is generated by the workflow.
- conserved_scores.csv is a file containing all conserved scores. This file is generated by the workflow.
- het_visualization.html is an interactive output generated by the script.

Example:

`plot_heteroplasmy.py "Daucus carota" annotation.csv heteroplasmy.csv conserved_scores.csv vis_carota.html`

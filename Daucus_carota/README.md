Browser-based visualizations of potential heteroplasmic sites in chloroplast (plastid) and mitochondrial genomes of *Daucus carota* were constructed based on 34 publicly available samples .

Users can explore potential heteroplasmic sites across all samples. Each site is color coded based on its major allele: red (A), blue (C), green (G), purple (T), and orange (deletion); a heteroplasmic insertion is shown when the site is hovered over. Color intensity represents the variant's major allele frequency.

To use these visualizations, first download the .html files to your computer.  To do this, first, click on the links to the files above; then, right click on the [*Download* button](Instruction.png); and select *Save link as...* to download the file to your computer.

Final, open each .html file using a browser such as Safari, Chrome, or Firefox.

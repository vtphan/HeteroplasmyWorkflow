In this folder, you will find visualizations of potential heteroplasmic sites in chloroplast (plastid) and mitochondrial genomes of Daucus carota, based on 34 publicly available samples.

These browser-based interactive visualizations are created by icHET. They let users explore potential heteroplasmic sites across all samples. Each site is color coded based on its major allele: red (A), blue (C), green (G), purple (T), and orange (deletion); a heteroplasmic insertion is shown when the site is hovered over. Color intensity represents the variant's major allele frequency.

This folder includes sample outputs from the visualizations of potential heteroplasmic sites in chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of Daucus carota.

The interactive output is in HTML format. The output shows the visualization of candidate heteroplasmic variants across all samples.  Each site is color coded based on its major allele: red (A), blue (C), green (G), purple (T), and orange (deletion); a heteroplasmic insertion is shown when the site is hovered over.   Color intensity represents the variant's major allele frequency.

Interactive controls that allow users to filter data and navigate to a specific gene or chromosomal coordinate. The visualization also has toolbox, which allowa users to zoom, pan and navigate the visualization.
